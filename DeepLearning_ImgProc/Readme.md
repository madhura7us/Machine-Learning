This project is to implement and evaluate convolutional neural network on celeba dataset. 
Here we have implemented the Convolutional Neural network with keras with tensorflow in the back end. 
We have sorted the data based the attributes of eyeglasses into two folders,as specs and no specs using opencv and used to train and validate.
We have implemented dropout regularization and data augmentation as it provides very good convergence and high accuracy. 
We varied the training data, size of the images,number of layers, number of nodes in each layer,dropout rate.
The final accuracy was obtained as 96.95%
